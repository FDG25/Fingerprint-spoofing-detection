# Ml_project

Project of the Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course, made by a group of 2 people in <a href='https://www.python.org/' target='_blank'>Python</a> with the <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/' target='_blank'>VsCode</a> IDE. The goal of the project is the development of a classifier to detect whether a fingerprint image represents an authentic fingerprint or a spoofed fingerprint, i.e., a fingerprint image obtained by cloning, possibly with different methods, the fingerprint of an individual. In the project have been considered different working priors, implemented and employed different classifiers (Gaussian, Logistic Regression, SVM, GMM, Fused Models), in order to choose the best one.
